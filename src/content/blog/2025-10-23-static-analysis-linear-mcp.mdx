When agents interact with external tools, two factors become critical: context management and token efficiency. 
As Anthropic has emphasized in [this article](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents), building effective tools for agents requires thinking like an agent and testing and improving MCP servers with agents. 

While testing MCP servers with agents and improving them through agents is inevitable, there's valuable insight to be gained from static analysis alone. 
This post takes a static approach to examining the [Linear MCP server](https://linear.app/docs/mcp), exploring what we can learn just by looking at its structure, tool definitions, and design choices. 
Of course, for comprehensive evaluation, running this server with an actual agent is essential but even before that step, certain patterns emerge.

Why Linear? In developer communities, Linear consistently comes up as one of the MCP servers that genuinely improves productivity. It lets users query tickets, create issues, and update status directly from their IDE. That makes it an ideal candidate for understanding what good MCP design looks like.

## What can be statically analyzed in an MCP Server

Looking at Anthropic's guidance on building agent-friendly tools, we can examine three key aspects through static analysis:

- **API Endpoints vs. MCP Tools**:  A thoughtful implementation doesn't simply wrap every available REST or GraphQL endpoint as a separate tool. We should compare the underlying API surface with the MCP tool set: Are all endpoints exposed? Are related operations consolidated? How many tools exist, and is that number optimized for effective context management?
- **Input Parameter Validation and Error Messages**: Using the MCP Inspector, we can evaluate how the server handles inputs: Are parameters clearly defined? Does the validation provide helpful feedback? Do error messages guide the agent toward correct usage?
- **Output Structure and Signal Quality**: We can examine what the server returns: Is the output format consistent and well-structured? Does it contain high-signal information that agents can actually use, or is it cluttered with noise?

The following analysis focuses on what the MCP Inspector reveals about Linear's implementation across these three dimensions. 

## API Endpoints and MCP Tools
Linear provides a [GraphQL API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference). 
Comparing Linear's GraphQL API and Linear's MCP server, the MCP server is doing more than just a simple 1:1 mapping of the GraphQL schema. 
Here are the key differences:

- **Simplified filtering/querying**: The list tools (`list_issues`, `list_projects`, etc.) provide curated parameter sets rather than exposing Linear's full GraphQL filter capabilities. For example, `list_issues` has specific filters like `teamId`, `stateId`, `assigneeId` rather than the complex nested filter objects GraphQL typically uses.
- **Convenience methods**: `get_issue_git_branch_name` is a higher-level abstraction that likely extracts just the branch name from an issue, rather than making you fetch the whole issue and parse it.
- **Non-GraphQL functionality**:  `search_documentation` tool adds Linear's documentation to the MCP server and provides information the GraphQL API doesn't reveal.
- **Opinionated parameters**: Things like priority being explicitly documented as `0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent...` suggest the MCP server is adding human-friendly documentation on top of what might be more opaque in the raw GraphQL schema.

This is a thoughtfully designed abstraction layer, not just a mechanical mapping. 
It's making Linear easier to use programmatically by providing task-oriented tools rather than schema-oriented access.

## MCP Server Input Parameter Validation and Error Messages
The Linear MCP server provides helpful validation feedback. For non-required fields, validation is strict and informative. Pagination cursors (`before` and `after`) must be valid UUIDs, and color codes require proper hexadecimal format:

```json
// Input with invalid pagination cursor
{
  "limit": 50,
  "before": "test",
  "orderBy": "updatedAt"
}
// Output 
"Error": "Argument Validation Error - before is not a valid pagination cursor identifier."
```

For required fields like entity IDs, malformed values return clear messages like "Entity not found: Project," though this doesn't distinguish between validation failures and genuinely missing entities. The error messages are consistently descriptive, providing agents with enough context to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## MCP Server Output
When it comes to server output, there are two aspects worth examining:

### High Signal Information
Responses like `list_users` return comprehensive fields including `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `avatarUrl`, `isAdmin`, `isGuest`, and detailed status information. When an agent simply wants to assign an issue to a user, fields like avatar URLs and timestamps add noise rather than value. 
Additionally, adding a [ResponseFormat enum](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/tutorials/writing-effective-tools/#returning-meaningful-context-from-your-tools) could control verbosity. It offers both concise and detailed response modes depending on the use case.

### Output Format
The Linear MCP server returns data wrapped in a nested structure where actual content is stringified JSON within a text field:

```json
// Input
{
  "query": "fiberplane"
}

// Output
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"id\":\"xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx\",\"icon\":\"Chip\",\"name\":\"Fiberplane\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-03-22T17:42:34.376Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2025-10-20T02:14:34.144Z\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```
This nested structure with JSON-as-string means agents must parse responses twice: First extracting the text field, then parsing the JSON string. For large datasets like `list_users` or `list_issue_labels`, this is token-heavy. [Axiom's research](https://axiom.co/blog/designing-mcp-servers-for-wide-events) shows CSV format can significantly reduce token consumption for tabular data.
Since Linear operations often return lists of structured entities (users: id/name/email, labels: name/color/description), CSV format could meaningfully improve context efficiency.

## Conclusion

The Linear MCP server demonstrates thoughtful design that goes beyond simple API wrapping. 
Its abstraction layer over GraphQL provides task-oriented tools with simplified filtering, convenience methods, and human-friendly documentation—making it genuinely useful for agent-driven workflows.

Two areas warrant attention: **high-signal information** and **output structure**. 
Reducing low-signal data (like avatar URLs when agents just need to assign users) and adopting more token-efficient formats like CSV for large datasets would meaningfully improve context efficiency and reduce token costs.

Static analysis offers a practical first step for identifying optimization opportunities. 
As Anthropic's research has shown, agents interpret responses in remarkably human-like ways. What's clear and efficient for humans often translates well for agents.
By examining tool definitions, parameter validation, and output structure, we can spot inefficiencies before running agent interactions.

However, static analysis has limits. The real test comes from dynamic evaluation. 
Running servers with agents in actual workflows, measuring token consumption, and identifying where context management breaks down. 
Only then can we validate whether static observations translate into measurable improvements.
