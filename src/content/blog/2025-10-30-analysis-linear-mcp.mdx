When agents interact with external tools, two factors become critical: context management and token efficiency. 
As Anthropic emphasized in the post [Writing Effective Tools](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents), building an effective toolset for an agent requires thinking like an agent. 

While testing MCP servers with agents and improving them through agents is inevitable, there's valuable insight to be gained from a review alone. 
This post takes a manual approach to examining the [Linear MCP server](https://linear.app/docs/mcp), exploring what we can learn just by looking at its structure, tool definitions, and design choices. 
Of course, for comprehensive evaluation, running this server with an actual agent is essential, but even before that step, certain patterns emerge.

Why Linear? In developer communities, Linear consistently comes up as one of the MCP servers that genuinely improves productivity. 
It lets users query tickets, create issues, and update statuses directly from their IDE. We at Fiberplane use Linear ourselves for project management. 
We’re also big fans of how the MCP integration brings Linear’s functionality straight into the IDE, reducing context switching. 
That makes Linear an ideal candidate for exploring what good MCP design looks like.

## What can be analyzed in an MCP Server

Taking Anthropic's tips for agent-friendly tools, we can review an MCP server with a few (anti-)patterns in mind:

- **API Endpoints vs. MCP Tools**:  A thoughtful implementation doesn't simply wrap every available endpoint as a separate tool. We should compare the underlying API surface with the MCP tool set: Are all endpoints exposed? Are related operations consolidated? How many tools exist, and is that number optimized for effective context management?
- **Input Parameter Validation and Error Messages**: Using the MCP Inspector, we can evaluate how the server handles inputs: Are parameters clearly defined? Does the validation provide helpful feedback? Do error messages guide the agent toward correct usage?
- **Output Structure and Signal Quality**: We can examine what the server returns: Is the output format consistent and well-structured? Does it contain high-signal information that agents can actually use, or is it cluttered with noise?

The following review focuses on what the MCP Inspector reveals about Linear's implementation across these three dimensions. 

## Linear's MCP Server: A First Look

The Linear MCP server exposes 23 tools that cover the most common Linear workflows. These tools fall into several categories:

- **Querying entities**: list_issues, list_projects, list_teams, list_users, list_documents, list_cycles, list_comments, list_issue_labels, list_issue_statuses, list_project_labels
- **Reading details**: get_issue, get_project, get_team, get_user, get_document, get_issue_status
- **Creating**: create_issue, create_project, create_comment, create_issue_label
- **Updating**: update_issue, update_project
- **Knowledge tools**: search_documentation

Consider a typical agent workflow: A developer asks their AI assistant to "create a bug ticket for the authentication issue and assign it to Sarah." The agent would:
1. Use `list_users` to find Sarah's ID
2. Use `list_teams` to identify the correct team
3. Use `list_issue_labels` to find the "bug" label
4. Call `create_issue` with the gathered IDs

Or when a developer asks "what are the open issues assigned to me?", the agent would:
1. Call `list_issues` with assignee set to "me" (the server accepts "me" as a value)
2. Filter by the desired state

These workflows demonstrate how the MCP server's tools are designed for task completion rather than raw API access. With this context in mind, let's examine how Linear's implementation compares to its underlying GraphQL API.

## API Endpoints and MCP Tools
Linear provides a [GraphQL API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Linear-API/variant/current/schema/reference). 
Comparing Linear's GraphQL API and Linear's MCP server, the MCP server is doing more than just a simple 1:1 mapping of the GraphQL schema. 
Here are the key differences:

- **Simplified filtering/querying**: The list tools (`list_issues`, `list_projects`, etc.) provide curated parameter sets rather than exposing Linear's full GraphQL filter capabilities. For example, `list_issues` has specific filters like `teamId`, `stateId`, `assigneeId` rather than the complex nested filter objects GraphQL typically uses.

For instance, filtering issues by assignee in the GraphQL API requires a nested filter object:
```graphql
query {
  issues(filter: { 
    assignee: { 
      id: { eq: "user-uuid" } 
    } 
  }) {
    nodes { id, title }
  }
}
```

The MCP server simplifies this to a flat parameter:
```json
{
  "assigneeId": "user-uuid",
  "limit": 50
}
```

This flattening reduces the cognitive load for agents. Fewer nested structures mean fewer tokens and clearer parameter requirements.
- **Knowledge tools**: The `search_documentation` tool adds Linear's documentation to the MCP server and provides information that their core API doesn't contain.
- **Explicit value mappings**: The MCP server documents parameter values directly in tool descriptions. For example, priority is explicitly defined as `0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Normal, 4 = Low`, making these mappings immediately clear to agents without requiring external documentation lookups.

This is a thoughtfully designed abstraction layer, not just a mechanical mapping. 
It's making Linear easier to use programmatically by providing task-oriented tools rather than schema-oriented access.

## MCP Server Input Parameter Validation and Error Messages
The Linear MCP server provides helpful validation feedback. For non-required fields, validation is strict and informative. Pagination cursors (`before` and `after`) must be valid UUIDs, and color codes require proper hexadecimal format:

```json
// Input with invalid pagination cursor
{
  "limit": 50,
  "before": "test",
  "orderBy": "updatedAt"
}
// Output 
"Error": "Argument Validation Error - before is not a valid pagination cursor identifier."
```

For required fields like entity IDs, malformed values return clear messages like `"Entity not found: Project"` (though this doesn't distinguish between validation failures and genuinely missing entities). The error messages provide agents with enough context to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## MCP Server Output
When it comes to server output, there are two aspects worth examining:

### High Signal Information
Responses like `list_users` return comprehensive fields including `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `avatarUrl`, `isAdmin`, `isGuest`, and detailed status information. When an agent simply wants to assign an issue to a user, fields like avatar URLs and timestamps add noise rather than value. 
Additionally, implementing a [ResponseFormat enum](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/tutorials/writing-effective-tools/#returning-meaningful-context-from-your-tools) could control verbosity. It offers both concise and detailed response modes depending on the use case.

### Output Format
The Linear MCP server returns data wrapped in a nested structure where the actual content is stringified JSON inside a `"text"` field:
```json
// Input
{
  "query": "fiberplane"
}

// Output
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"id\":\"xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx\",\"icon\":\"Chip\",\"name\":\"Fiberplane\",\"createdAt\":\"2020-03-22T17:42:34.376Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2025-10-20T02:14:34.144Z\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```
From the model's perspective, this means it doesn't see structured JSON; it sees a string of escaped characters, such as `\"id\":\"123\"`, rather than `{ "id": "123" }`.
The model must therefore implicitly “unescape” and interpret this data token by token, which increases parsing complexity and context cost. 
For large or repetitive responses like `list_users` or `list_issue_labels` this stringified format can significantly inflate token usage and degrade reasoning performance.

Studies such as [Wang et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13478) compare text-serialization formats in terms of computational and representational efficiency across systems.
It’s not surprising that LLM-focused research and practical experiments reach the same conclusion — more compact, regular formats like CSV or TSV tend to be both cheaper in tokens and easier for models to interpret than deeply nested or stringified JSON.
This pattern is echoed in applied analyses such as [Axiom’s MCP efficiency research](https://axiom.co/blog/designing-mcp-servers-for-wide-events), and [David Gilbertson’s token-cost comparison](https://david-gilbertson.medium.com/llm-output-formats-why-json-costs-more-than-tsv-ebaf590bd541).

Since Linear operations often return lists of structured entities (for example, users: id / name / email, or labels: name / color / description), adopting a CSV format could meaningfully improve context efficiency.

#### Client side: Model dependent format handling
While compact formats like CSV tend to be efficient across the board, different language models vary in how reliably they process structured data.
Benchmarks such as [StructEval (Yang et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20139)
and [FOFO (Zhang et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442)
evaluate models’ ability to generate and convert structured outputs, revealing that adherence to formats like JSON, XML, and CSV varies significantly across models.
For instance, GPT-4 typically maintains JSON syntax with high fidelity but can misinterpret heavily escaped or stringified content, whereas Claude 3 models often handle XML- or Markdown-style tags more consistently.
Together, these findings suggest that format robustness is model-dependent, and that input and output serialization choices can materially affect model reliability.

When building MCP servers, we can't control which model the client uses.
These benchmarks show that models struggle more with complex or deeply nested structured formats than with simpler table- or record-style outputs. 
Therefore, in practice we should favour a simpler, flatter data representation.


## Conclusion

The Linear MCP server demonstrates thoughtful design that goes beyond simple API wrapping. 
Its abstraction layer over GraphQL provides task-oriented tools with simplified filtering, convenience methods, and human-friendly documentation—making it genuinely useful for agent-driven workflows.

Two areas warrant attention: **high-signal information** and **output structure**. 
Reducing low-signal data (like avatar URLs when agents just need to assign users) and adopting more token-efficient formats like CSV for large datasets would meaningfully improve context efficiency and reduce token costs.

A manual review offers a practical first step for identifying optimization opportunities. 
As Anthropic's research has shown, agents interpret responses in remarkably human-like ways. What's clear and efficient for humans often translates well for agents.
By examining tool definitions, parameter validation, and output structure, we can spot inefficiencies before running agent interactions.

However, a manual review has limits. The real test comes from dynamic evaluation—running servers with agents in actual workflows, measuring token consumption, and identifying where context management breaks down. 
Only then can we validate whether a review translates into measurable improvements.
