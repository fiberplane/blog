A well-optimized workflow can dramatically improve your productivity and code quality. Here's how to level up your development environment.

## Terminal Setup

Your terminal is your command center. Make it powerful:

- **Shell**: Consider switching to Zsh or Fish for better autocompletion
- **Prompt**: Use Starship or Oh My Zsh for a informative prompt
- **Multiplexer**: Learn tmux or use a terminal with panes like iTerm2
- **Aliases**: Create shortcuts for common commands

## Editor Configuration

Choose an editor and master it:

### VS Code Extensions

Essential extensions for modern development:

- **ESLint**: Catch errors as you type
- **Prettier**: Auto-format your code
- **GitLens**: Supercharge Git integration
- **Error Lens**: Inline error messages

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these productivity boosters:

- Multi-cursor editing
- Quick file navigation (Cmd+P)
- Go to definition (F12)
- Search across files (Cmd+Shift+F)

## Git Workflow

Streamline your version control:

```bash
# Create useful aliases
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status

# Interactive staging
git add -p

# Beautiful log
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

## Testing Strategy

Build quality in from the start:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test critical user flows
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing in your pipeline

## Documentation

Document as you go:

- Write README files for every project
- Add JSDoc comments to complex functions
- Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Maintain a personal wiki or notes

## Continuous Learning

Stay up to date:

- Follow key developers on social media
- Read technical blogs and newsletters
- Contribute to open source
- Attend conferences or watch talks online

## Conclusion

Small improvements to your workflow compound over time. Pick one area to focus on and iterate from there.
