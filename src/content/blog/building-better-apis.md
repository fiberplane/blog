APIs are the backbone of modern applications. Here's what we've learned about building great ones.

## Design Principles

Good API design starts with clear principles:

- **Consistency**: Use consistent naming and patterns throughout
- **Simplicity**: Make the simple things simple
- **Discoverability**: APIs should be easy to explore and understand
- **Versioning**: Plan for change from day one

## REST Best Practices

When building REST APIs, follow these guidelines:

### Use HTTP Methods Correctly

```typescript
// Good
GET    /users        // List users
POST   /users        // Create user
GET    /users/:id    // Get user
PUT    /users/:id    // Update user
DELETE /users/:id    // Delete user
```

### Return Appropriate Status Codes

Use status codes that accurately reflect the result:

- `200 OK` - Success
- `201 Created` - Resource created
- `400 Bad Request` - Client error
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

## Error Handling

Provide clear, actionable error messages:

```typescript
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid email address",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
```

## Documentation

Great APIs have great documentation:

- **Examples**: Include realistic examples for every endpoint
- **Schemas**: Document request and response schemas
- **Authentication**: Clearly explain auth requirements
- **Rate Limits**: Document any usage limits

## Conclusion

Building great APIs is an iterative process. Start with solid principles, listen to your users, and continuously improve.
